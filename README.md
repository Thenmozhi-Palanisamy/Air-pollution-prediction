# Air-pollution-prediction using machine learning
# Aim
The primary aim of an AI-powered Air Pollution Prediction project using Machine Learning is to develop a model that can accurately forecast air quality levels based on real-time and historical data. This helps in mitigating health risks, guiding environmental policies, and raising awareness about air pollution trends.

## About
Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict air pollution levels using real-time and historical data. By analyzing key air pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, and O3, the system forecasts the Air Quality Index (AQI) to provide timely warnings and insights. The project also includes real-time data analysis and visualization to help users understand pollution trends and take necessary precautions.
